        <div class="alpha">I'm Micah Press, a student at Brown University studying computer science and economics. For the past two summers I've worked for a 
            private wealth management firm and a technology scouting startup. During the school year I'm a teaching assistant for the Investments I class at Brown. 
            In my free time I like listening to hip hop and playing basketball, and I also hold three world records.</div>
